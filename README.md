# ekyc-middleware

* This middleware is used for in/out bound calls for any source(web/mobile/db).

* Specifically this one is only for ekyc but in future we will manage this as an api gateway to manage any in/out bound calls to our database server

* Since we are using spring boot hence it is highly configurable, for this one we are managing with properties file, in future we will use noSQL database like mongodb



## Technology stack

1. Spring-boot framework
2. Java 8
3. Maven
4. Html, css or any JS framework for front end
5. Log4j for logging

### Future Plan

1. Integrate with mongodb.
2. Integrate Jhipster to manage and create apis.
3. Highly configurable as api gateway
4. Automation
5. Automated test cases
6. Elastic search
7. Multiple Langauge Support
