# ekyc-middleware

* This middleware is used for in/out bound calls for any source(web/mobile/db).

* Specifically this one is only for ekyc but in future we will manage this as an api gateway to manage any in/out bound calls to our database server

* Since we are using spring boot hence it is highly configurable, for this one we are managing with properties file, in future we will use noSQL database like mongodb



## Technology stack

1. Spring-boot framework
2. Java 8
3. Maven
4. Html, css or any JS framework for front end
5. Log4j for logging
